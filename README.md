### Art Piece 1

After scouring the Internet for intriguing art that was both engaging and interactive, I came upon the following pieces. Both pieces captured my interest almost immediately.
	The first piece I found is titled “Infinity Mirrored Room - Filled With the Brilliance of Life”, and it was created by Japanese artist, Yayoi Kusama, in 1960. According to the Guggenheim Museum’s website, the piece “invites reflection and redefines conceptions of space and time” and “displays Kusama’s lifelong obsession with the concept of infinity”. The latter concept particularly resonated with me, as I was drawn to this piece by its seeming endlessness. As I watched a video of the piece in action, the space felt infinite, cosmic in its vastness. The light clusters formed pillars of sorts, and paired with the multitude of tiny dots of light, it created a fascinating effect. I felt as if I had grown a hundred times my own size, like a King Kong sized Cara, and was gazing upon New York City at night. There’s also something charming in the black silhouettes of the piece’s viewers appearing ‘trapped’ within the infinity the art constructs. Or maybe they are moving within infinity, unaffected.

### Art Piece 2

TThe second piece I came across is the Architects of Air’s monumental luminaria, created by artist Alan Parkinson. Parkinson said he created the luinaria because he wanted to share his “sense of wonder at the phenomenon of light”. The installation travels across the globe, having reached over 3 million people in over 40 countries since its inception in 1992. The piece is mesmerizing, because it creates a world within the world. When you step inside the inflatable installation, you abandon our physical world and step into a different one - a world of light. As a viewer, it’s as if you’ve been shrunken into a kaleidoscope. I’m drawn to the all-encompassing nature of this piece, and in the fact that you are a part of it when you enter. It’s not merely a piece of art you stare at, but you can move within it. It’s a sculpture you exist inside of.
