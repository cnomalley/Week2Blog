When looking for artists who have delved into chance operations to produce work, I immediately stumbled across John Cage. I’m familiar with some of his work (specifically 4’33”) from my “Sounds, Art and Abstraction” class that I took my freshman year, but I was not familiar with his chance operation music. The music is called aleatoric music, and its style dictates that an element of composition is left to chance. One of his pieces is titled Imaginary Landscape No. 4 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfwrFl1FHM), and it consists of “12 radios all playing at the same time, but all tuned to different stations”. There’s a fascinating randomness, a spontaneity, that results in this style of composition. John Cage’s has always been experimental, and it’s neat to see (or hear) the ways that he plays with chance and uncertainty. Even 4’33”, the piece of his I learned about years ago, could be arguably a result of chance operations (human behavior in the midst of discomfort).
	Another artist I came across in my search was Kenneth Martin. Kenneth Martin was a 20th century English painter and sculptor. His piece Chance and Order is composed of lines coming together at different angles, colliding with one another and constructing odd shapes (piece is pictured below; part of a larger series). Chance and Order was made by utilizing chance; however, it was not with code, though it could easily incorporate code if recreated. Specifically, the piece was made using small cards with different numbers (that represented grid points). The small cards were randomly picked out, resulting in where the lines of the piece would be constructed. According to the Tate Museum’s website, the exact process is as follows… “To create the network of lines, the artist first marked a drawing with points, moving clockwise round a rectangle. Lines were then generated by taking numbers, two at a time, at random out of a bag. Martin chose eight pairs of numbers for this work. He then instigated the Change of the title by turning the drawing through 90 degrees and repeating the process. This process was repeated twice more.” (http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/martin-chance-order-change-6-black-t03190)
